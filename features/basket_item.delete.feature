        When I set the request header "X-GUEST-TOKEN" to: "e50e542b-5206-489e-bf0b-79e2e2b0338b"
        And I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/basket/95386f2f-2e68-490f-9dc7-3fd7905c6e4f/item/32e4f1b4-c102-41d3-bb5a-b692cf498e01"
        Then the response status code should be 204
        And the response should be empty
        And the basket item entity with identifier "32e4f1b4-c102-41d3-bb5a-b692cf498e01" should have been deleted
